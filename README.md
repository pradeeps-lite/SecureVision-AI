Project Overview

SecureVision AI is an advanced surveillance system that uses AI + CV + Cyber-secured communication to:

✔ Detect unsafe events in real-time

Such as:

Unauthorized human entry

Suspicious movements

Mask detection

Violence detection

Fire/smoke detection

Object abandonment (bag, weapon, etc.)

✔ Face Recognition Module

Recognizes known staff/students

Flags unknown persons

Flags AI-generated faces (deepfakes)

✔ Secure Web Dashboard

Real-time camera feed

Live detections with bounding boxes

Login-secured admin panel

Alert history logs

Event analytics

✔ Alerts & Notifications

Email/SMS/PWA notifications for alerts

Auto-trigger alarms for emergencies
